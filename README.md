# Sudoku Solver with Forward Checking CSP

## Overview
This repository contains Python code for solving Sudoku puzzles using the Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) approach with forward checking. The solver efficiently explores possible solutions by applying constraints and backtracking to fill in the Sudoku grid with valid numbers.

## Features
- **Forward Checking**: Utilizes forward checking to reduce the search space and improve efficiency.
- **Sudoku Difficulty**: Can solve Sudoku puzzles of varying difficulties.
- **Modularity**: Code is organized into clear functions for readability and maintainability.
- **Documentation**: Includes detailed comments and documentation to facilitate understanding and modification.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Sudoku-Forward-Checking-CSP.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
   ```bash
   cd Sudoku-Forward-Checking-CSP
   ```

3. Run the `sudoku_solver.py` script with Python:
   ```bash
   python sudoku_solver.py
   ```

4. Follow the instructions to input your Sudoku puzzle or modify the `initial_puzzle` variable in the script with your desired Sudoku grid.

5. View the solved Sudoku puzzle in the console output.

## Example
```python
# Example Sudoku board
initial_puzzle = [
    [5, 3, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [6, 0, 0, 1, 9, 5, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 9, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0],
    [8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 3],
    [4, 0, 0, 8, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1],
    [7, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6],
    [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 9, 0, 0, 5],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 7, 9]
]

print("Initial Sudoku:")
print_sudoku(initial_puzzle)

solution = solve_sudoku_csp(initial_puzzle)

if solution:
    print("\nSolved Sudoku:")
    print_sudoku(solution)
else:
    print("\nNo solution found.")
```
